 Script kiddie (Wannabe red team operator). Someday il
 get some skills :cry:
 
 I like developing offensive tools e.g. red team implants/droppers, C2 infra and other general offensive research. I usually post misc offensive tooling such as aggressorscripts, beacon object files and some red team automation scripts/tools.
