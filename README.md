I'm a kid who likes developing offensive tools e.g. red team implants/droppers, C2 infra and other general offensive research. I occasionally clean up some of the tools/scripts I create over time and post them here.

## Red team gitbook
I sometimes document random offensive research I do in my free time on this gitbook.
