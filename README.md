 Script kiddie (Wannabe red team operator). Someday il
 get some skills :cry:
 
 I like developing offensive tools e.g. red team implants/droppers, C2 infra and other general offensive research. I'll post anything here as long as open sourcing said tool won't affect it's usability (e.g. shellcode loaders getting sigged by AV vendors etc.)
 
## Stuff I post here
- Useful scripts for red teams
- injection/evasion/execution PoCs
- Misc offensive tooling
