# Hi, I'm CodeX üñ•Ô∏è

 Script kiddie (Wannabe red team operator). Someday il
 get some skills :cry:
 
 I like developing offensive tools e.g. red team implants/droppers, C2 infra and other general offensive research. I'll post anything here as long as open sourcing said tool won't affect it's usability (e.g. shellcode loaders getting sigged by AV vendors etc.)
 
## Planned open source projects
- Beacon Object Files
- Offensive infrastructure components (custom redirectors? Maybe similar to mgeeky's RedWarden)
- AggressorScripts
- Useful scripts to automate offensive tradecraft
- Small POCs of existing techniques

  
[Check out my gitbook :D](https://codex-7.gitbook.io/codexs-terminal-window/)
## About me 

- :video_game: I like to play TF2
