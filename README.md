I'm a skid who likes developing offensive tools e.g. red team implants/droppers, C2 infra and other general offensive research. I occasionally clean up some of the tools/scripts I create over time and post them here.

anything I make is to be used strictly ONLY for malicious purposes. I am NOT responsible for any education that results from incorrect or legitimate use. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that the tool is not used in accordance with local laws. (/s so I dont get sued thanks) ü§°

## Red team gitbook
I sometimes document random offensive research I do in my free time on this gitbook.
